# 👋 Hey there, I'm Jeevesh Malhotra

### 🧠 Builder | 🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Dev | 📱 App Enthusiast | 🛠️ Debug Ninja

Welcome to my digital playground! I’m a 20-year-old CS student with a passion for building things that just work — from sleek mobile apps to robust backend systems. Whether it’s wiring up a Flutter UI, managing REST API data flow, or optimizing a SQL join that just won’t cooperate — I’m all in.

## 🚀 What I'm About

- 🛒 Currently building a **production-grade e-commerce frontend** using **React Native + Medusa JS**
- 📦 Architected a **REST API with Django** and used **PostgreSQL** to create a backend for both app and web-app, including user auth, csv-upload/download for data storage, form-upload
- 🔐 Deployed a working **WireGuard proxy tunnel via Fly.io** (Just to bypass hostel WiFi)
- ⚙️ Obsessed with clean code, seamless UX, and "why-is-this-breaking" level debugging

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- ReactJS (with hooks, context, custom components)
- TypeScript (✨ type-safety for the win)
- React Native (for cross-platform mobile apps)
- Flutter and Dart (for smooth, small-scaled apps and web-apps)

**Backend**
- Django (REST API development, auth, ORM)
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase, with JSON & CSV handling)

**DevOps / Tools**
- Git & GitHub (obviously)
- Fly.io, Render, Netlify
- AsyncStorage, Zod, TanStack Query

**Languages**
- JavaScript / TypeScript (ReactJS + NodeJS + ReactNative)
- HTML / CSS
- Python (Flash + Django)
- Dart (Flutter)
