# Hi, I'm Jeevesh Malhotra 👋  
**(GitHub: Parker2107)**

I’m a Computer Science undergrad building scalable full-stack apps and solving real-world problems. I specialize in web and mobile development using modern tools and technologies.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend / APIs:** Node.js, Express, MedusaJS, REST/GraphQL  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- **Dev Tools:** Git, React Query, Expo, Jest, Playwright  
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python

---

## 🚀 Highlight Projects

### 🛒 E-Commerce & Checkout Modules
- Custom React Native checkout flow built with MedusaJS backend — includes multiple steps for address, shipping, and Razorpay payment integration.
- Integrated **address selection & validation**, dynamic shipping options, and robust error handling.
- Solved tricky issues like lowercasing country codes, dynamically fetching shipping prices, and synchronizing payment sessions with Medusa.

### 💳 Razorpay Integration
- Implemented **RazorpayPaymentButton** in React Native.
- Handled payment initiation, session validation, and real-time user flow.
- Managed edge cases: "cart not ready", delayed session creation, and conditional rendering based on payment session state.

### 🔄 Real-Time UI Feedback
- Smooth UI patterns for loading states and error alerts.
- Streamlined checkout with animated modals, scroll-to-refresh, and contextual disabling of buttons.
- Excellent UX even in poor network conditions — consistent state syncing with `react-query` and Medusa.

---

## 💡 Strengths & Approach

- **Clean & reactive UI designs** — built with React Native and React Query.
- **State-driven flows** — orchestrating shipping and payment via Medusa.
- **Error-first thinking** — writing resilient code with meaningful logs and graceful fallbacks.
- **Collaborative coding** — modular, reusable components with thorough inline documentation & state checks.
